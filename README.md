# React Native app for Home Assistant

This app is in its development stage.

The target platform is Android.

##Setting up a dev environment
To get started with development, you need a React Native dev environment. 
See [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for instructions.

After that, clone the project, cd into the project, and run:

`npm install` or, if you use yarn (it's as easy as `npm install -g yarn`): `yarn install`

`react-native run-android`

If the react native server has not started, run

`react-native start`

code is in `src/`
